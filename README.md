# Furrycorn

Custom-made Battlerite API access framework.


## Rationale

Although the Madglory BattleRite API is built on the jsonapi standard, the
author of this library couldn't find an implementation he liked.

This library is an express opinion the best way to consume the BattleRite API.


## Type Fetishism

This library tries its hardest to ensure the main source of complexity is the
composition of types. Side effects (operations which are dangerous to repeat)
are kept obvious and at a minimum.


## Usage

For now, see `examples/usage.py`.
